# React-Multi-tier

To run the application locally, you will need to install Node.js and install the dependencies for your application. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```s
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local development server. You can then view the login form by accessing it through the local development server's URL, which is:

```s
http://localhost:5000
```

If you want to host your application on a web server, you will need to build the application for production and upload the built files to the web server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```s
npm run build
```

This will create a build directory that contains the built version of your application. You can then upload the contents of the build directory to your web server.
